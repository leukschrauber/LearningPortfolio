# LearningPortfolio

This repository is my learning portfolio for the seminar Digital Organizations at the University of Innsbruck.

It contains Jupter Notebooks, where I log my learnings and apply them to practical problems. 
All of them contain a theoretical section, where I describe what my key learnings where from the respective Assignment and Learning Portfolio.
Also all of them contain a practical application. Most often, a data set from kaggle is used to demonstrate what I learned.

The folders for the parts of the portfolio each contain the notebook, a condensed presentation and usually the data being used in the Notebook.

I hope you have as much exploring these as I did.
